#List comprehension
#Create a list of numbers

numbers = [1,2,3]

# new_list = [new_item for item in old_list]

new_numbers = [n+1 for n in numbers]
print(new_numbers)

#Can also use list comprehension for other sequences eg strings

name = "Mathew"
new_list = [letter for letter in name]
print(new_list)

#use range and list comprehension
#new_list = [new_num for num in range()]
doubles = [2*n for n in range(1,5)]
print(doubles)

#Conditional list comprehension
#new_list = [new_item for item in list if test]

#eg only return short names from a list of names
names = ["Oogie-Boogie","Jack", "Sally","Pumpkin King", "Professor", "Mayor of Halloweentown"]
short_names = [name for name in names if len(name) < 6]
print(short_names)

#change the long names to upper case
long_names = [name.upper() for name in names if len(name)>5]
print(long_names)
