#Instructions
#You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. 
#This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

squared_numbers = [num**2 for num in numbers]

print(squared_numbers)

#List Comprehension 2
#You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. 
#This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

result = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(result)
